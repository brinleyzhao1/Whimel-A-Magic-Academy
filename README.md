# 06-Zombie-Runner
In this section we create a First Person Shooter with a zombie theme. We cover raycasting for shooting and the core mechanics you'd expect in an FPS. This repo is part of our Complete Unity C# Developer 3D course (http://gdev.tv/cu2github). (Ref: ZR_CU2)

# Complete Unity Developer 3D - Zombie Runner

This is the [Complete Unity Developer 3D](http://gdev.tv/cu2github) - one of the most successful e-learning courses on the internet! Completely re-worked from scratch with brand-new projects and our latest teaching techniques. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught half a million students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Complete Unity Developer 3D](http://gdev.tv/cu2github)
